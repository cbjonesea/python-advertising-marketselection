 Python data exploration to find the two best markets for advertising an e-learning platform

## Description
In this practice project, I assume that I'm working for an an e-learning company that offers online courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but the company also covers many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. It wants to promote its product and it wants to invest some money in advertisement.

The goal in this project is to find the two best markets for advertising the e-learning platform.

To reach this goal, the company could organize surveys for a couple of different markets to find out which would be the best choices for advertising. However, this is very costly. It would be more efficient to first explore cheaper options, such as using existing sources of market research and surveys.

## Methodology
To select these markets, I use data from an existing survey conducted by FreeCodeCamp as a sample of the population of people we would like to target with advertising: new coders or coders interested in continuing education. This will help narrow down which two markets are the best for our advertising campaign.

The main questions I wanted to answer are:
- What types of development and tech jobs are survey respondents most interested in?
- What are the locations with the greatest number of coders?
- How much money are new coders willing to spend on learning?
 
By answering these questions, I will then suggest which two national markets would be the best for advertising.

After I've answered those questions, I thought of other ways to disaggregate the data for analysis. I considered looking at:
- Gender
- Age
- Relevant events & media (e.g. podcasts) used by respondents

I know that within tech fields, underrepresentation of women is a major problem, and contributes to gender discrimination in terms of unequal pay, workplace harassment and a lack of technology being made with the needs of women in mind. I therefore decided to explore the gender breakdown of respondents: how many men vs. women participated in the survey and whether there are differences in job role interests, location or ability to pay between genders.

## Findings & Conclusions
The conclusions for these questions were:
- Web development and mobile development had by far the most interest among respondents overall, particularly web development. Data science took third place in overall interest.
- Most of the survey respondents were located, in descending order, in the US, India or UK
- Respondents in the US & the UK had the most available money to spend monthly, on average, for learning resources

Based on these conclusions, I recommend the US and India as the two best national markets for advertising:
- The US, because it has the most survey repsondents by far (almost 50% of total responses) and respondents had on average the most available money to spend monthly on learning
- India, because although it came third place in available money to spend per month, it came second place in total number of respondents, indicating a larger base of potential customers than countrie that had higher avaiable money to spend monthly


My findings from the gender analysis were that:
- Men represent a clear majority (76%) over women (23%) in survey respondents
- While the US, India and the UK were the countries with most respondents overall, the top 3 countries for female respondents were the US, UK and Canada
- Surprisingly, considering the average gender pay gap between men and women across the world, female respondents reported, on average, a larger amount of money available to spend on learning resources per month than male respondents
 
My conclusions for the gender analysis of the sample were that:

Since female respondents show an even greater ability to pay monthly for learning than male respondents and are underrepresented both in the sample and in tech fields worldwide, the company could both boost its users and help contribute to reducing gender inqeuality by targeting advertising or even offering discounted rates to interested female learners in the field of web and mobile development.
